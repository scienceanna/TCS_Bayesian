SUPP MAT

- Make priors a bit broader in Fig 3.1 ANNA H
- Go do something with power models ALASDAIR
- What model diagnostics to report in supp mat? Print summary? ANNA H
- Run model with shuffle noise, 6 samples, sft, expt 1 ANNA H
- Reimplementation: calculate better R^2 values D ~ 1*Dp+0

MANUSCRIPT

- Talk to Alejandro about OC model ALASDAIR
- Sft model where sigma can vary with log(NT + 1). Try to fit models? ANNA H - PAUSE FOR NOW
- Add a bit more text about the reasoning behind hypothesis 2

EXPERIMENT NOTES

- Hypotheses - 1. increase distractors, 2. within subj - individual differences, 3. distributional predictive model. Individual differences (and more sophisticated RE structures) as exploratory analysis
- Change features?
- Draft up an R script to turn Pavlovia data into useful input for models
