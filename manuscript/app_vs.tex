\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Target Contrast Signal Theory: "precise mathematical model that allows one to make specific point predictions about how components of visual complexity combine to impact human performance".

Model predicts search performance in heterogeneous scenes based on parameters estimated in homogeneous scenes. 

\paragraph{}

Buetti (2019): Parallel search efficiency (logarithmic search slope) to find target amongst homogeneous distractors estimated: different colours (red target in orange, blue, yellow distractors) or shapes (semicircle target in circle, diamond, triangle distractors) tested. 
New group of participants searched for same target in heterogeneous displays that contained multiple types of distractors (e.g. blue circles, orange diamonds, yellow triangles). Observed RTs in latter experiment compared to predicted reaction times from model.

\paragraph{} 

Current extension ideas:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1a. Direct replication, online? 
\item 1b. Now with a different feature? Non independent features e.g. orientation and shape 
\item 2. Extend number of distractors (does loglinear relationship hold)
\item 3. Overall harder (where does the model break down, if it's only supposed to do "parallel" search?)
\end{itemize}

Incorporate within subject predictions - have the same participants do homogeneous and heterogeneous versions.

Do we want to also re-analyse any of their data? Incorporating accuracy? 
(Calculate the range of Ds for both sets - speculate if one explains the other?)
